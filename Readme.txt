1. Make sure that the folder names don't change. Framework uses these names when it imports modules created off of the model code repo.

2. Every package has a Readme file with instructions. Make sure those instructions are read first before implementing this model project. 

3. Make sure to double check the contents in setup.py file and don't change the code inside which isn't supposed to be changed. Change the placeholders only. This file would be used by the framwork to create a standard distributable library for the model. 

4. For your bitbucket repository name, replace word skeleton with your model name.
